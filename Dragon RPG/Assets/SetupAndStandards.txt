#Setup and Standards Doc
The purpose of this short doc is to get us all on the same page rgarding a few important things such as world scale, layers, prefab setups, etc.

## World Scale and Origin
We will be using Unity's default 1 m = 1 Unity Unit.  Not animations don't scale well.  Y=100m is the deepest water bottom. All terrains at Y=-100, flatten land to +100.

## Layers
So far the layers of note are 'Walkable' and 'Enemy'.  Note: it is the collider that receives the raycast, so do apply layers to children.

## Ramp Angles
Maximum ramp Z value = 15
For longer ramps = 10.
